		<h1>About The Founders</h1>
		<h3>Jeffrey Valcius</h3>
			<p>With a love for and determination to play soccer, Jeffery moved to Canada at the age of 16. Like most players with a skill to perfect, things took off quickly and his parents watched as determination turned to action. Jeffrey started off playing for St. Joseph Secondary School and later transferred to play for St. Augustine Secondary School in Brampton, Canada. With dreams to play at the Collegiate level, Jeffrey wanted to further perfect his craft. To do so, Jeffrey attended a Villanova University Camp in Philadelphia, USA, where he was noticed and scouted by Lander University, South Carolina. His dream come true, Jeffrey played left back and completed his 4 year degree. Realizing his love for soccer behind the scenes, Jeffrey decided to move back to Canada, where he received his National B license and jumped into coaching soccer for Woodbridge OPDL. Today, Jeffrey continues to coach as well as recruits for Coaches to continue the legendary service that is FutureStar Sports.</p>
